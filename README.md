Neural Networks are often described as black boxes. This project however, presents a method based on the interpretation of the internal parameters of a neural network to implement an application capable of:
- Detecting the presence of humans in a live video
- Identifying *"regions of interest"* where the individuals detected are most likely to be situated

This method was introduced in the following paper: [Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization](http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/Zhou_Learning_Deep_Features_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).

Its originality comes from the simplicity of both the network it uses and of the training it requires.

- An explanation of this method and of the specific problem it is applied to in this project can be found in the [`Project Report`](https://SelimChraibi.github.io/real-time-human-detection/) page.

- A demonstration of how the code shared in this repo can be used (to create classification models capable of outputting localisation information) can be found in the jupyter notebook [`demo.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SelimChraibi/real-time-human-detection/blob/master/demo.ipynb).

## Getting started with the code

Create a conda environment from the `yml` file and activate it:

``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ml-environement
```

You should be ready to use the `webcam_cam.py` app and the `demo.ipynb` notebook.

> Note: CUDA and cuDNN are required for GPU support and donâ€™t come with the conda environment mentioned above.
>- [Installing CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)
>- [Installing cuDNN](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html)


## Application using the trained models

Launching the live webcam application:

``` sh
python3 webcam_cam.py --model ./saved_model/mobilenet_with_gi_data.h5
```

>**Requires:**
>Tensorflow version     >= 1.7
>Keras version         >= 2.1
>OpenCV version         >= 3.3
